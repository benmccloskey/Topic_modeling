Topic Modeling Analysis Code
I am providing code for various information that can be extracted from a text data. This code was used for a Text Mining Project that involved analyzing and uncovering latent characteristics in a text Corpus of Online Restuarant Reviews gathered from Facebook, TripAdvisor, Yelp, and Google Reviews.

**DataFrame Set-Up**

All of my data was loading into the IDE as a panda's dataframe. I original had the data in a CSV file with the following collumns:

Month-Year - Review - Platform - Rating

**Month** - The month in which the review was posted.

**Year** - The year in which the review was posted.

**Review** - The review itself. There was NO quotations/special characters added to the reviews unless added by the reviewer.

**Platform** - The online platform where the review was posted.

**Rating** - The rating given to the review.
